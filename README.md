In the era of big data and [artificial intelligence](https://realpython.com/python-ai-neural-network/), [data science](https://realpython.com/tutorials/data-science/) and [machine learning](https://realpython.com/tutorials/machine-learning/) have become essential in many fields of science and technology. A necessary aspect of working with data is the ability to describe, summarize, and represent data visually. **Python statistics librarie**s are comprehensive, popular, and widely used tools that will assist you in working with data.

**In this tutorial, you’ll learn:**

° What **numerical quantities** you can use to describe and summarize your datasets
° How to **calculate** descriptive statistics in pure Python
° How to get **descriptive statistics** with available Python libraries
° How to **visualize** your datasets
